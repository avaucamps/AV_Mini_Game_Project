# What is this Game :
It's a game that lets the user builds a subway network based on a map he chooses.

# How does it work ?
At the beginning 3 stations appear on the map. Every 10 seconds 2 new passengers appear at different stations. The user's goal is to 
connect the stations using different lines composed of segments. Once two stations are connected, a metro starts moving on the line. Every
time it arrives at a station it loads and unloads the passengers, which gives the user points. And every week int the game (2 minutes 
and 10 seconds) the user can choose a bonus that is proposed to him. Then as long as there are less than 6 passengers waiting at 
each station, the game continues. But if there are more than 5 passengers waiting at a station, a timer starts and 
the user has 30 seconds to decrease the number of passengers waiting otherwise he looses the game !
